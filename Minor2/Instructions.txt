Instructions to Place the Project folder and Test the Functionality of 'User Information Form' webpage.

1.Download XAMPP installer to configure - Apache , MySQL , PHP.
  XAMPP Installer : https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

2.Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

3.Open web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. (This will help in managing the Database)
  Here , you might need to create a database table and link it with 'php' code.
  In our php code, I have named the DB as 'user_verification'.
  According to our 'php' code , run following SQL query using 'phpMyadmin' to avoid any errors: 
  
  CREATE TABLE user_entries (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    gender ENUM('male', 'female', 'other') NOT NULL,
    dob DATE NOT NULL,
    aadhar VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL,
    pan VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    tenthPercentage INT(3) NOT NULL,
    twelfthPercentage INT(3) NOT NULL,
    aadharFile VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    panFile VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    tenthFile VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    twelfthFile VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);


4.Place project folder ("Minor") in the 'htdocs' directory inside XAMPP installation folder (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\Minor).

5.Access webpage by navigating to http://localhost/Minor/form.html

6.Test functionality to ensure documents are saved in the uploads directory(check inside XAMPP/htdocs/Minor/uploads) and records are created in the documents table (check using phpMyadmin).Also I have written the code so that as user submits his details, CSV file for particular user entry will be saved in 'csv_files' folder inside 'Minor' folder.
